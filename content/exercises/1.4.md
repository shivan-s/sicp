## Question
> Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expres- sions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b) 
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

## Solution

```scheme
; b is checked for positive or negative and this determines the operator for a and b

(define (f a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

(f 1 2)
(f 1 -2)
```

Output: 

```
3
3
```
