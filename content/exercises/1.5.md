## Question
> Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

```scheme
(define (p) (p)) 
(define (test x y)
(if (= x 0) 0 y))
```
> Then he evaluates the expression

```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```
> What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evalu- ation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the in- terpreter is using normal or applicative order: predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)


## Solution

```scheme
#lang scheme

; applicative order - p is returned and this is the same for normal order?

(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0) 0 y))

(test 0 (p))

(exit)
```
