> Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```
> Using the substitution model, illustrate the process gener- ated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?
